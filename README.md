# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning (End-to-End Flask App)

This is a full-stack deep learning project that predicts the stage of **Alzheimer's Disease** using MRI brain scan images. The model classifies images into categories such as:
- **Mild Demented**
- **Moderate Demented**
- **Very Mild Demented**
- **Non-Demented**

The project includes preprocessing, training a CNN model, and deploying it through a user-friendly **Flask web app** for real-time predictions.

## 📁 Dataset

We use a labeled MRI dataset with the following classes:
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Non-Demented
